This is an informal description of changes made at Stanford
to DEC FORTRAN (F40) and runtime (LIB40).

At the moment (07/09/76) this file describes only those changes
made by Erik J. Gilbert in the recent past.  Previous Stanford mods
(e.g. those by Ralph Gorin and Andy Moorer) are not idiscussed here.

Hopefully, future mods to the compiler will have an entry made in this
file, but don't count too heavily on it.


The recent *EJG* changes were made mostly to implement one modification.
This was to implement the newer hardware double precision floating point
number format, insteead of the older software format.  Normally, both
the KI-10 and KL-10 support both formats, but the Stanford KL-10
microcode locations for the instructions UFA, DFN, FADL, FSBL, FMPL,
and FDVL were usurped for other purposes.  So, these instructions are
available only through very slow monitor level emulation.

Also, a few changes were made (those to FORSE, DATBS, and ERROR) to
implement a fix to a "bug" in the processing of the REREAD statement.
Previously, FORTRAN did not correctly implement REREAD when the line
to be reread was split across a buffer boundary.  This has been changed
so that whenever such a split line is encountered, it is copied into
an auxiliiary buffer area for use by a REREAD.


The double precision changes obviated the need for special subroutines
to do double precision flooting point arithmetic, so the routines
DFM.., DFDV, DFMP, and DFAS were deleted from the library (LIB40.REL).

If it is ever necessary to generate a version of the compiler using
the software format, this should be possible by restoring the above
modules to LIB40.REL, and by reassembling the changed modules with
assembly time parameters changed as follows:
  1.)	In F40 (modules FX1,FX2,FX3,FX4), make HARDFL undefined by
	removing the statement giving it a value.
  2.)	All LIB40 modules may be changed by changing the header file
	DEF40.  KI10 should be set to zero and KA10 set to one.
