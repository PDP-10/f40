	THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN V31 AND V30 ARE:
	NEW FLOATING OUTPUT ROUTINE IS MORE ACCURATE
	CHARACTER OUTPUT IS NOW ABOUT THREE TIMES AS FAST AS BEFORE.
	ALL KNOWN BUGS IN THE REENTRANT OPERATING SYSTEM FIXED
	RANDOM ACCESS CHANGED TO USE DUMP MODE, AND TO KEEP CURRENT
	BLOCK IN CORE LONGER. THIS REDUCES DISK ACCESSES.
	OVER ONE HUNDRED BUGS FIXED.

31-02   RELEAS          VAA

        Symptom:        Can't RELEAS a unit  that  has  been
                        initialized  for  random  access and
                        use that unit again with a different
                        filename.     Error    message    is
                        "FILENAME---NOT ON DEVICE DSK".

        Diagnosis:      The filename did not get cleared  in
                        the random access table 'FILES' 

        Cure:           1.  Insert after CLRRER+4

                            SETZM FILES.-5(B)
                            SETZM FILES.-4(B)

                        2.  Declare files. External



31-03   MANUAL          VAA

        Symptom:        In calls to define file LOOKUPS fail
                        or  wrong  filename is produced when
                        either the extension is less than  3
                        characters  or  the filename is less
                        than 6 characters with no  extension
                        and   the  file  NAME.EXT  has  been
                        specified in either a data statement
                        or   read  into  a  single  word  at
                        runtime.

        Diagnosis:      In define when reading filename  ext
                        a  double  word  is expected in case
                        there are  nine  characters.   If  a
                        filename  with  no extension is read
                        or  an   extension   less   than   3
                        characters,  define  goes  down into
                        the next word to find the  remaining



                        characters    whether    this   word
                        contains the correct data or not.

        Cure:           User must use an extension when file
                        name   is   specified   in   a  data
                        statement or read in at runtime.

31-04   ERROR           DMN

        Symptom:        Programs failing  because  of  fatal
                        I/O  errors print error summary with
                        no errors detected.

        Diagnosis:      ERRCNT only applied to errors in the
                        traps tape and ASIN/ACOS.  SQRT (-1)
                        etc.

        Cure:           Define new type of error.  Fatal I/O
                        error  put in it ERRTBL.  Make clse.
                        Add 1 to ERRCNT and fill in table so
                        at least one error is output.



31-05   FORSE           VAA

        Symptom:        "ILL MEM REF"  when  user  tries  to
                        read  past  end  of  file on DSK/DTA
                        through calls to  EOFC.   or  "end="
                        used  more  than  once  on same unit
                        when that unit is DSK/DTA.

        Diagnosis:      End of file status is always cleared
                        when  end of file is seen even if it
                        is DSK/DTA.

        Cure:           New  EOFTST.:/TLNN   I,40   ;DSK/DTA
                        followed by old EOFTST.
                        PUSHJ P,CLOSI.  ;NO, CLEAR EO



31-11   DOUBT           DMN

        Symptom:        Integer overflow on D.P.  Output  of
                        0.100D+00.

                        order word into high order word does



                        not turn off overtrap.

        Cure:           Ensure  message   never   going   to
                        overtrap.



31-12   FORSE           DMN

        Symptom:        Single quotes and non equal  formats
                        interact unfavourably.

        Diagnosis:      Single quote flag is never cleared.

        Cure:           After et: POP P,0 insert TLZ I, 1000


31-14   FORSE           DMN

        Symptom:        STR 10-3072 I format (as opposed  to
                        i15)  does  not  work  if CR is last
                        thing in buffer.

        Diagnosis:      FORSE twice scans to the  CR.   i.e.
                        Loses 1 line.

        Cure:           Change BUFST+5/SETZM  OVFLS.   (LOW)
                        to SKIPE OVFLS.(LOW) JRST PPN+1

        Symptom:        Multiple  record  formats   do   not
                        output   correctly  when  the  1  is
                        followed by tab.

        Diagnosis:      Tab is converted to sixbit by TRC 40
                        and  dispatched  via on index table.
                        should convert tab to space first.

        Cure:           at in

Deficiencies found in FORTRAN library update "A" to  Version
30.

These errors were reported while  the  FORTRAN  library  was
being  tested  using the reentrant operating system (FORSE).
The number,if any,  preceeding  the  problem  indicates  the
software trouble report associated with it.

SPR#            PROBLEM

485     DOUBT-   .1000000000000000d+03   is    output    as:
        .9999999999999999D+02 that is the rounding is off at
        16 places.

2621    NAMELIST has trouble with reading data that does not
        follow the NAMELIST output format exactly.

( )     Magnetic tape  simulation  on  disk  can  cause  the
        associated  data file to be truncated.  That is when
        the file is opened for reading and some records read
        and  then  records  are  written  beginning with the
        record following the last record read, the file  may
        be  truncated  if  the last record number written is
        not less than or equal to the largest record  number
        in the file before writing took place.

( )     During  a  random  access  test  the  error  message
        'ILLEGAL  CHARACTER  IN  INPUT  STRING' was reported
        when the following sequence took place.  Call define
        file  on  unit  write  file  backwards  on unit call
        RELEAS on unit read random record on unit
        This is because call to  RELEAS  clears  the  random
        access status.

*******4 series bug*********
( )     End of file  is  not  detected  properly  on  random
        access input files either through the "end=" feature
        or by default.  The reason was  that  USETO  cleared
        end  of  file  status  under 4 Series Monitors.  The
        patch  to  correct  this  will  be  printed  in  the
        Software Bulletin as MCO# 939 for 4 Series Monitors,
        patch level bv.

4360	ERR=n in non-Formatted read is ineffective.
	Error message for parity error gives nonsense unit.
	There is no way to get past "dirty tape" records.

4355	BACKSPACE statement apparently fails to backspace ASCII records.

4252	Backspace of a binary file on disk does not work. Instead
	of backspacing 1 record it backspaces to the beginning of file.

4185	LIB40 requires two termination characters at the end of each
	line in order to successfully recognise that a line has ended.

3996	Reread doesn't work on device DSK0 through DSK4.

3144	A skip record is apparently ignored if logical record size is 	
	< 1 physical record but is executed properly if > 1 physical
	record.
	A read-write sequence leaves an extra record on the tape. This
	is due to double-buffered read being one buffer ahead and not
	re-positioning itself properly.
